#00 ?{ #2a18 DEO } #2b18 DEO

#0a18 DEO
( is the same as )

#00 ,&true JCN #2a18 DEO &true #2b18 DEO

#0a18 DEO
( and )

#01 ?{ #2a18 DEO } #2b18 DEO

#0a18 DEO
( is the same as )

#01 ,&true2 JCN #2a18 DEO &true2 #2b18 DEO

( so we can replace ?{ by ,&true JCN and } by &true )
( or to play it safe ;true JCN2 and @true )
( which means it is the same treatment as the ordinary lambda )
