( Uxntal comments are enclosed in "( "  and " )" 

This is an Uxntal program but the purpose is to explain the basics of the syntax. Please read `ex00_basics.md` first.

) 

|0000 ( People usually write this indicate the start of the memory region. )

( to create a register, you write an @ followed by the name. Like a variable name, a register name in Uxntal can be anything )
@x $2 ( The $2 means that we reserve 2 bytes for the content of this register )
@y $2
@long_reg_name $8 

|0100 ( every program starts at address 256. the '|' means padding, it is a way to say that all memory before this line that is not used, should be filled with zeroes. )
