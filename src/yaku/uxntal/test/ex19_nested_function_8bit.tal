( how do we get the rel address? We'd need the abs address of the current location )
( #0000 JSR POP STH2r  STH2r )
( now we have the abs address from the RS )
( SUB2 NIP ) ( this is the difference between those 2 addresses; keep 1 byte )
( #0d ADD ) ( offset the calculation itself )
( #00 SWP SUB ) ( invert the rel dist )
( JMP )
