@x $2
|0100 ( every program starts at address 256 )

#0006 .x STZ2k ( put 6 on the stack as a 2-byte (16-bit, short in Java/C) constant.
Store it in .x and keep the arguments, so now #0006 and .x are on the stack
)
LDZ2  ( load .x, this puts #0006 on the stack )
INC2 ( increment, so +1, so #0007 )
MUL2 ( multiply the value on the top of the stack, 6, with the value below that, 7 )
#18 DEO ( prints '*' in the terminal, because 42 is the ASCII code for '*' )
( DEO means 'device output' and #18 is the output port for the terminal, like StdOut in Java )
